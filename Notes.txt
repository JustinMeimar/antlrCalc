These are some notes about ANTLR to re-read in the fall when I forget
everything I've learned while being in Europe. 

Library Structure. 

-compiled librarys, both static and dynamic located in 
    /usr/local/lib/antlr4-runtime.{a/so}

-header files located in 
    /usr/local/include/antlr-runtime/

-auto gen Parsre, Lexer, Visitor, Listener etc files from .g4 grammar file with
    antlr4 -Dlanguage=Cpp -visitor -o /gen grammar.g4

-by deafult antlr sets up a parse tree (Lite.Parser ) and the associated walk functions
found in antlr4::tree::

-to do a particular action on a walk, extend the LiteBaseListener class

Listeners are called automatically by the ANTLR-provided walker object. while
visitors must explicitly invoked. 
    (Done by walking the parse tree by accessing children of each node and calling visit recursively)
